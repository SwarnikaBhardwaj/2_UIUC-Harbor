WORK DIVISION:

- Task 6 (Extra): Created Models for Conversation, Message, Service Request, and Reviews - Ananya


EXPERIENCE NOTES:
HttpResponse vs render():
- HttpResponse useful for simple responses, API endpoints, or when you need full control over HTML
- render() is much cleaner for template-based views, better separation of concerns
- We prefer render() for most cases as it's more maintainable

Base CBV vs Generic CBV:
- Base CBV gives more control but requires more boilerplate
- Generic CBV (ListView) is incredibly fast for standard list/detail pages
- Generic CBVs follow Django conventions, making code more predictable
- We'll use Generic CBVs for standard CRUD, Base CBVs for custom logic

Understanding and Personal Development
- Struggled with understanding some file structures
- Familiarizing ourselves with navigating and collaborating on GitHub
- More comfortable working on the application and better understanding of our base layer


Week 3 Progress (section 1 and 2)

SECTION 1 - URL Linking , Navigation
1 Implemented get_absolute_url() in Student, Category, Listing models
2 Created home page at root URL (/)
3 Added navigation bar with {% url %} tags (no hardcoded paths)
4 Created detail pages for Listings, Students, Categories using PKs

SECTION 2 - ORM Queries , Data Presentation
1 GET search: /search/?q=term - shareable, visible in URL
2 POST filter: /filter/ with price range - hidden from URL
3 Relationship-spanning query using __ : category__name filtering
4 Aggregations used are count() for totals, annotate(Count()) for grouping
5 Templates use {% for %} and {% empty %} properly

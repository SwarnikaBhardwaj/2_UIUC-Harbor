Harbor - Campus Marketplace
Week 1 Progress (February 6, 2026)

COMPLETED TODAY:
- Django project setup (Harbor)
- Created 3 models: Student, Category, Listing
- Database migrations completed successfully, admin panel configured
- Repository structure reorganized
- Settings split into dev/prod environments
- Environment variables secured with .env
- .gitignore configured

WORK DIVISION:
- Task 1: Settings refactor, security, environment setup - Swarnika
- Task 2: Function-based views (HttpResponse, render) - Melissa, Urvi
- Task 3: Class-based views (Base View, ListView) - Melissa and Urvi
- Task 4: Templates (base.html, inheritance, loops) - Katherine
- Task 5: Documentation, README, final review - Ananya, Urvi, Melissa
- Task 6 (Extra): Created Models for Conversation, Message, Service Request, and Reviews - Ananya

EXPERIENCE NOTES:
HttpResponse vs render():
- HttpResponse useful for simple responses, API endpoints, or when you need full control over HTML
- render() is much cleaner for template-based views, better separation of concerns
- We prefer render() for most cases as it's more maintainable

Base CBV vs Generic CBV:
- Base CBV gives more control but requires more boilerplate
- Generic CBV (ListView) is incredibly fast for standard list/detail pages
- Generic CBVs follow Django conventions, making code more predictable
- We'll use Generic CBVs for standard CRUD, Base CBVs for custom logic

Understanding and Personal Development
- Struggled with understanding some file structures
- Familiarizing ourselves with navigating and collaborating on GitHub
- More comfortable working on the application and better understanding of our base layer


Week 3 Progress

SECTION 1 - URL Linking , Navigation
1 Implemented get_absolute_url() in Student, Category, Listing models
2 Created home page at root URL (/)
3 Added navigation bar with {% url %} tags (no hardcoded paths)
4 Created detail pages for Listings, Students, Categories using PKs

SECTION 2 - ORM Queries , Data Presentation
1 GET search: /search/?q=term - shareable, visible in URL
2 POST filter: /filter/ with price range - hidden from URL
3 Relationship-spanning query using __ : category__name filtering
4 Aggregations used are count() for totals, annotate(Count()) for grouping
5 Templates use {% for %} and {% empty %} properly

SECTION 3

SECTION 4
- Created new visualizations to aggregate listings by type
- Need to understand how to share data with teammates while data is contained in the gitignore
- Used the Django ORM annotate and Count functions to group listings by category and calculate totals
- Used io.BytesIO to handle image data in-memory, to avoid unnecessary disk writes
SECTION 5
- Added a GET search form at /search/ and a POST price filter at /filter/.
- Inputs are handled safely with request.GET/request.POST and {% csrf_token %} for security.
- Results display properly in templates, including when no listings match.
